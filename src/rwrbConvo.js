He pulls a painfully fake grin, and June looks satisfyingly repulsed.</span>

    The second for using Rich Girl so that the other side of the album is London Luck & Love: <span>Outside his window, the wind stirs up over the lawn, rustling the linden trees down in the garden. The record on the turntable in the corner has spun out into fuzzy silence. He rolls off the bed and flips it, resetting the needle, and the second side picks up on “London Luck, & Love.”</span>`,

    The second quote shows how much of a romantic Alex is despite what happened to his parents: <span>It's just that Martha is a perfectly respectable daughter of nobility, and Philip is a prince. It's as sexy as a business transaction. There's no passion, no drama. Alex's kind of love story is much more Shakespearean.</span>

    Love this glimpse into Alex's drive/reasons: <span>Alex's whole reason for wanting to go into politics, when he knows so many past presidential sons and daughters have run away screaming the minute they turned eighteen, is he genuinely cares about people. The power is great, the attention fun, but the people—the people are everything. He has a bit of a caring-too-much problem about most things, including whether people can pay their medical bills, or marry whomever they love, or not get shot at school.</span>

    One of the things I really missed in the movie, which stripped Alex of an important layer 😭😭: <span>“I don't know. Doing what we do is fucking hard. But it's harder for me. I'm the son of the first female president. And I'm not white like she is, can't even pass for it. People will always come down harder on me. And you're, you know, you, and you were born into all of this, and everyone thinks you're Prince fucking Charming. You're basically a living reminder I'll always be compared to someone else, no matter what I do, even if I work twice as hard.”</span>
    
    LOVE Star Wars references!!! Also a first look at the real Henry: <span>“Hmm,” Henry says, making a show of thinking hard. “I always liked Luke. He's brave and good, and he's the strongest Jedi of them all. I think Luke is proof that it doesn't matter where you come from or who your family is—you can always be great if you're true to yourself.”</span>`,

I have June and Nora.” “Yes, your sister and a girl who is also a supercomputer,” Luna deadpans. “You need to take some time for yourself before you burn out, kid. You need a bigger support system.”</span>

    Ellen using kids for her campaign while disregarding their thoughts about it (mostly June): <span>His mom pretends to be annoyed but slyly asks for intel later. <...>“Baby girl,” their mom says.

    The beginning of texts and banter (MY ABSOLUTE FAVE!!💖💖) while discovering Henry's hidden depths and choosing not to filter himself (I think subconsciously Alex just wants to let go of the perfect FSOTUS mask he puts on everyday): <span>He knows he talks too much, hopeless at moderating his feelings, which he usually hides under ten layers of charm, but he ultimately doesn't care what Henry thinks of him, so he doesn't bother. Instead, he's as weird and manic as he wants to be, and Henry jabs back in sharp flashes of startling wit.</span>

    Another excerpt that shows how much Alex carries and how it weighs on him: <span>But Alex is the golden boy. The heartthrob, the handsome rogue with a heart of gold. The guy who moves through life effortlessly, who makes everyone laugh. Highest approval ratings of the entire First Family. The whole point of him is that his appeal is as universal as possible. Being... whatever he's starting to suspect he might be, is definitely not universally appealing to voters. He has a hard enough time being half-Mexican.</span>

    Love how Casey wrote Alex's [freight] train of thought here and in this chapter, it helped me understand the character much better: <span>There's a short article accompanying the photos that gives the girl's name, Emily something, an actress, and Alex was generally pissed before, but now he's very singularly pissed, his entire shitty mood funneled down to the point on the page where Henry's lips touch somebody's skin that's not his. <...> Faintly, under it all, it occurs to him: This is all a very not-straight way to react to seeing your male frenemy kissing someone else in a magazine.</span>`,

There's a tense set to his shoulders Alex hasn't seen in months, not directed at him at least. “I'm going to let you say what you need to say,” Henry says flatly, “so you can leave.” Alex stares. “What, and then we're over?” Henry doesn't answer him."</span>

You don't make it fucking easy. But I'm in love with you.” A small click cuts the silence: Henry has taken his signet ring off and set it down on the mantel. He holds his naked hand to his chest, kneading the palm, the flickering light from the fire painting his face in dramatic shadows. “Do you have any idea what that means?”"</span>

    <span>"“Well,” Alex says. “I do. And you can choose.” “You know bloody well I can't.” “You can try,” Alex tells him, feeling as if it should be the simplest fucking truth in the world. “What do you want?” “I want you—” “Then fucking have me.”"</span>

    <span>"Alex turns away from him, falling back on his heels like he's been slapped. “Fine,” he finally says. “You know what? Fucking fine. I'll leave.” “Good.” “I'll leave,” he says, and he turns back and leans in, “as soon as you tell me to leave.” “Alex.” He's in Henry's face now. If he's getting his heart broken tonight, he's sure as hell going to make Henry have the guts to do it right. “Tell me you're done with me. I'll get back on the plane. That's it. And you can live here in your tower and be miserable forever, write a whole book of sad fucking poems about it. Whatever.
