He pulls a painfully fake grin, and June looks satisfyingly repulsed."</span>

    The second for using Rich Girl so that the other side of the album is London Luck & Love: <span>"Outside his window, the wind stirs up over the lawn, rustling the linden trees down in the garden. The record on the turntable in the corner has spun out into fuzzy silence. He rolls off the bed and flips it, resetting the needle, and the second side picks up on “London Luck, & Love.”"</span>`,

Baby, Please Don't Go? <span>"He finds Luna in his office, horn-rimmed reading glasses doing nothing to detract from his usual appearance of a movie star who tripped and fell sideways into politics. Alex has always suspected the soulful brown eyes and perfectly groomed stubble and dramatic cheekbones won back any votes Luna lost by being both Latino and openly gay. The album playing low in the room is an old favorite Alex remembers from Denver: Muddy Waters.

You're Jeff Goldblum. Go to sleep.”"</span>

    message: `Short one but two postings that launched a thousand fics: the first, Henry's notable shoulder to waist ratio: "He thinks about Henry's voice low in his ear over the phone at three in the morning, and suddenly he has a name for what ignites in the pit of his stomach. Henry's hands on him, his thumbs braced against his temples back in the garden, Henry's hands other places, Henry's mouth, what he might do with it if Alex let him. Henry's broad shoulders and long legs and narrow waist, the place his jaw meets his neck and the place his neck meets his shoulder and the tendon that stretches the length between them, and the way it looks when Henry turns his head to shoot him a challenging glare, and his impossibly blue eyes—"

    And the second, everyone's favorite character to hate on - WASPy Hunter: "Which is how he finds himself out of breath on a Monday afternoon after class, following a staffer who's managed to surpass even him in the caffeination department, on a breakneck tour of the campaign offices. He gets a badge with his name and photo on it, a desk in a shared cubicle, and a WASPy cubicle mate from Boston named Hunter with an extremely punchable face."`,

    "“Shut up, shut all the way up, oh my God,” Alex hisses, and if he weren't already hell-bent on destroying Henry's infuriating idiot face with his mouth right now, he would consider doing it with his fist. He's focused on the burst of adrenaline carrying his feet over the antique rug, Henry's tie wrapped around his fist, the flash in Henry's eyes. He reaches the nearest wall, shoves Henry against it, and crushes their mouths together."

    "Turns out being on the receiving end of Henry's royal authority is an extreme fucking turn-on. He thinks, as he's hauled into a bruising kiss, that he'll never forgive himself for it. So, like, fuck the moors."

    message: `Narrowed down to 3 selections, the first because it shows that Alex understands and loves every part of Henry: "Henry hates those days completely. Alex wishes he could help, but he doesn't particularly mind. He's just as attracted to Henry's cloudy tempers, the way he comes back from them, and the millions of shades in between."

    The second because it's a rare example where the movie dialogue improved upon the book: "“The official family name is Mountchristen-Windsor,” Henry says. “Hyphenate, like yours. So my full name is… Henry George Edward James Fox-Mountchristen-Windsor.” Alex gapes up at the ceiling. “Oh… my God.” “Truly.” “I thought Alexander Gabriel Claremont-Diaz was bad.”"

    And lastly June saying what we all are thinking: "June makes a strangled noise, and when he looks back up, she's digging through the top drawer of her dresser. “Oh my God, how are you so smart and so dumb at the same time?” she says, pulling a magazine out from underneath her underwear. He's about to tell her he's not in the mood to look at her tabloids when she throws it at him. An ancient issue of J14, opened to a center page. The photograph of Henry, age thirteen."`,

    "“I think I've proven that I can handle royals.” Henry looks doubtful. “You're brave. I could use some of that.”"
    "“I'll have a gin and tonic, thanks,” it says, and there's Henry in the flesh, sidled up next to him at the bar, looking a little tousled in a soft gray button-down and jeans. Alex wonders for an insane second if his brain has conjured up some kind of stress-induced sex mirage, when Henry says, voice lowered, “You looked rather tragic drinking alone.”"
    "“You still are. Because you still bloody care so much.” He leans down and presses a kiss into Alex's hair. “And you are good. Most things are awful most of the time, but you're good.”"`,

    "The next slide is titled: EXPLORING YOUR SEXUALITY: HEALTHY, BUT DOES IT HAVE TO BE WITH THE PRINCE OF ENGLAND? She apologizes for not having time to come up with better titles. Alex actively wishes for the sweet release of death. The one after is: FEDERAL FUNDING, TRAVEL EXPENSES, BOOTY CALLS, AND YOU."
    "June plucks away at “Annie's Song,” you fill up my senses like a night in a forest, and the breeze keeps moving to meet the highest branches of the trees, and the water keeps rising to meet the bulkheads, and Henry leans down to meet Alex's mouth, and Alex is. Well, Alex is so in love he could die."
    "“I didn't realize this was a jazz brunch,” says Nora's voice suddenly, and Henry springs backward so fast he almost puts his ass in the bowl of batter. She sidles up to the forgotten coffeemaker, grinning slyly at them."`,

    "“I'd rather not do this where we might be overheard,” Henry says, taking a left on the landing. Alex stomps up after him, following him into his bedroom. “Do what?” he says as Henry shuts the door behind them. “What are you gonna do, Henry?” Henry turns to face him at last, and now that Alex's eyes aren't full of rainwater, he can see the skin under his eyes is papery and purple, rimmed pink at his eyelashes. There's a tense set to his shoulders Alex hasn't seen in months, not directed at him at least. “I'm going to let you say what you need to say,” Henry says flatly, “so you can leave.” Alex stares. “What, and then we're over?” Henry doesn't answer him."
    "“Jesus, could you stop being an obtuse fucking asshole for, like, twenty seconds?” “So glad you flew here to insult me—” “I fucking love you, okay?” Alex half yells, finally, irreversibly. Henry goes very still against the mantelpiece. Alex watches him swallow, watches the muscle that keeps twitching in his jaw, and feels like he might shake out of his skin. “Fuck, I swear. You don't make it fucking easy. But I'm in love with you.” A small click cuts the silence: Henry has taken his signet ring off and set it down on the mantel. He holds his naked hand to his chest, kneading the palm, the flickering light from the fire painting his face in dramatic shadows. “Do you have any idea what that means?”"
    "“Well,” Alex says. “I do. And you can choose.” “You know bloody well I can't.” “You can try,” Alex tells him, feeling as if it should be the simplest fucking truth in the world. “What do you want?” “I want you—” “Then fucking have me.”"
    "Alex turns away from him, falling back on his heels like he's been slapped. “Fine,” he finally says. “You know what? Fucking fine. I'll leave.” “Good.” “I'll leave,” he says, and he turns back and leans in, “as soon as you tell me to leave.” “Alex.” He's in Henry's face now. If he's getting his heart broken tonight, he's sure as hell going to make Henry have the guts to do it right. “Tell me you're done with me. I'll get back on the plane. That's it. And you can live here in your tower and be miserable forever, write a whole book of sad fucking poems about it. Whatever. Just say it.” “Fuck you,” Henry says, his voice breaking, and he gets a handful of Alex's shirt collar, and Alex knows he's going to love this stubborn shithead forever."`,

    "And what comes out of Alex's mouth, comes so fast he has no chance to stop it, only divert it out of English at the last second in case it's overheard: “Sería una mentira, porque no sería él.” It would be a lie, because it wouldn't be him."

If Henry's voice on the phone was a tether, his body is the gravity that makes it possible, his hand gripping the back of Alex's neck a magnetic force, a permanent compass north."
    "Alex sits, trying for a long moment to absorb it, and says, “I've never … I haven't been through anything like that,” he says, voice rough. “But I've always felt it, in him. There's this side of him that's … unknowable.” He takes a breath. “But the thing is, jumping off cliffs is kinda my thing. That's the choice. I love him, with all that, because of all that. On purpose. I love him on purpose.”"

    "Philip walks off, hands in his pockets, and all three of them watch his retreating back until it starts to disappear behind the tall hedges. Bea sighs. “D'you think I should have let him have a go at the cullen skink man for me?” “Not yet,” Henry says. “Give him another six months. He hasn't earned it yet.”"
    "She emerges with a hanger in her hand: a jacket he's never worn out before, one she convinced him to buy online for an obscene price the night they got drunk and watched The West Wing in a hotel in New York and let the tabloids think they were screwing. It's fucking Gucci, a midnight-blue bomber jacket with red, white, and blue stripes at the waistband and cuffs. “I know it's a lot, but”—she slaps the jacket against his chest—“you give people hope. So, get back out there and be Alex.” He takes the jacket from her and tries it on, checks his reflection in the mirror. It's perfect."
    "“Come on, you backyard-shooting-range motherfuckers,” Zahra is muttering under her breath beside him when he falls in with his people. “Did she just say backyard shooting range?” Henry asks, leaning into Alex's ear. “Is that a real thing a person can have?” “You really have a lot to learn about America, mijo,” Oscar tells him, not unkindly."
    "He's so caught up that he doesn't realize at first Henry isn't at his side, and he turns back to see him hovering in the wings, just behind a curtain. Always hesitant to step on anyone's moment. That's not going to fly anymore. He's family. He's part of it all now, headlines and oil paintings and pages in the Library of Congress, etched right alongside. And he's part of them. Goddamn forever. “Come on!” Alex yells, waving him over, and Henry spares a second to look panicked before he's tipping his chin up and buttoning his suit jacket and stepping out onto the stage. He gravitates to Alex's side, beaming. Alex throws one arm around him and the other around June. Nora presses in at June's other side. And President Ellen Claremont steps up to the podium."`,
